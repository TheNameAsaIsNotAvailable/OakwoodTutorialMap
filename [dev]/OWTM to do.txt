OWTM to do
-----------

- finish sfx
- finish collisions
- tweak shotgun anims (i.e. elbow angle + attribute keyframe position, to accommodate adjusted foregrip + 'bolt-action' reload)
- add other four coins + their lighting
- playtest again
- move player out of reach/view before map goes live
